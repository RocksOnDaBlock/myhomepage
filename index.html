  <p> Hi! My name is Dustin, welcome to my webiste :) Let me tell you a bit about myself -- 2019-2020 I was enrolled in & completed the CISCO IT Essentials course. Currently I am teaching myself web design (HTML,JS,CSS) as well as I'm taking the "Google IT Support" course on Coursera with the intention of taking the COMPTIA+ exam once finished. </p>
  <br>
  <p2>Network/System Administration is my main focus for a career with coding just being more of a hobby. This page is to act as my "portfolio" or "resume". It will contain links to or images of current/past projects.</p2>
