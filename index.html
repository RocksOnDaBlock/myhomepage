Currently I am teaching myself web design (HTML,JS,CSS) as well as I'm taking the "Google IT Support" course on Coursera with the intention of taking the COMPTIA+ exam once finished. </div>
  <div class="main"> Network/System Administration is my main focus for a career with coding just being more of a hobby. This page is to act as my "portfolio" or "resume". It will contain links to or images of current/past projects.</div>
