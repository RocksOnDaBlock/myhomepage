  <h2>Hi! My name is Dustin, welcome to my website :) Let me tell you a bit about myself -- 2019-2020 I was enrolled in & completed the CISCO IT Essentials course. Currently I am teaching myself web design (HTML,JS,CSS) as well as I'm taking the "Google IT Support" course on Coursera with the intention of taking the COMPTIA+ exam once finished. </h1>
  <br>
  <h3>I have strong interests in pursuing a career in either Network/System Administration or some sort of development role. I don't have strong skills in many coding languages but I have been learning. Right now HTML/CSS are what im most knowledgeable in & Im currently trying to learn JavaScript. Next will probably be Python. This website will hopefully become a reflection of my skills.</h3>
